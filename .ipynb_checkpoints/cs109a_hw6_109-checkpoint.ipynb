    "In this exercise we are going to use the **Pima Indians onset of diabetes** dataset found in `pima-indians-diabetes.csv`. This dataset describes patient medical record data for Pima Indians and whether they had an onset of diabetes within five years. It is a binary classification problem (onset of diabetes as 1 or not as 0). The input variables that describe each patient are numerical and have varying scales. The list below shows the eight attributes plus the target variable for the dataset:\n",

Look for missing data including disguised missing data. The problem of disguised missing data arises when missing data values are not explicitly represented as such, but are coded with values that can be misinterpreted as valid data. Comment on your findings.\n",

Fit a logistic regression classifier to the training set and report the  accuracy of the classifier on the test set. You should use $L_2$ regularization in logistic regression, with the regularization parameter tuned using cross-validation (`LogisticRegressionCV`).  Report the overall classification rate.\n",

    "**2.6** This question does not have one answer and requires some experimentation. Check which coefficients changed the most between the model in 2.1-2.2 and the models in 2.3 and 2.4. Are they the coefficients you expected to change given the imputation you performed? If not explain why (supporting your explanation using the data is always a good idea).\n"
